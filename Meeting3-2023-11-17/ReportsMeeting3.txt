# Meeting #3

Date: Nov 17, 2023
Online

We decided that we will try to maintain documentation about our meetings.

We decided that we keep our communications, and documention in English (as much as possible)
Was mentioned that ChatGPT does a great job in translating English text to other languages, so hoefully our decision will not create a barrier for members to engage with the content.
The other benefit of using English as the main language, is the possibility of collaborating with like-minded people in other places. Like the Phillipines, Mexico, Nigeria, Arab countries, etc.

We decided, we will create a Github account for Ready Board.
- [ ] Ali Padash, to do that.

We decided we will use the Google account for storing documents, etc. and will be shared amognst the admins.

Static websites using github and netlify
