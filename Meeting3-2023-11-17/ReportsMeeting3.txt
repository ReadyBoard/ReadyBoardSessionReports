Meeting #4
Date: Dec 8, 2023
Online

During this online session, we gathered to discuss the usage of GitHub. 
We created a new repository, shared it, and worked on a sample project involving a PCB and schematic. 
We added power to the schematic using LM2576, removed it, and then found it again in the repository. 
You can access the project in the following repository:

# Meeting #3

Date: Nov 17, 2023
Online

We decided that we will try to maintain documentation about our meetings.

We decided that we keep our communications, and documention in English (as much as possible)
Was mentioned that ChatGPT does a great job in translating English text to other languages, so hoefully our decision will not create a barrier for members to engage with the content.
The other benefit of using English as the main language, is the possibility of collaborating with like-minded people in other places. Like the Phillipines, Mexico, Nigeria, Arab countries, etc.

We decided, we will create a Github account for Ready Board.
- [ ] Ali Padash, to do that.

We decided we will use the Google account for storing documents, etc. and will be shared amognst the admins.
